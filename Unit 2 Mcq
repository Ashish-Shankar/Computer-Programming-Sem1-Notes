    **Answer:** C

17. **What is the effect of `*p = 10;` when `p` is an integer pointer in C pointing to a valid integer variable?**
    - A) Assigns `10` to `p` itself
    - B) Changes the value of the variable `p` is pointing to, setting it to `10`
    - C) Deallocates memory pointed to by `p`
    - D) Deletes the pointer `p`

    **Answer:** B

    - A) An integer pointer
    - B) A pointer pointing to a known memory location
    - C) A pointer that points to no memory location or an invalid memory address
    - D) A character pointer

    **Answer:** C
